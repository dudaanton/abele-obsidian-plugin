# Vault data

The shape of every kind of note the plugin owns: which `type` marks it, which properties it
carries, and where new ones are put. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` and times are `HH:mm` unless said
otherwise; a note that breaks that is a note the plugin will read wrongly.

## Naming notes

A note's name cannot carry `* " \ / < > : | ?` — Obsidian refuses those itself — nor `#`, `^`,
`[` or `]`, which it will write to disk and then never link to: `[[Note#x]]` addresses a
heading, `[[Note^x]]` a block, and a bracket ends the link.

`create`, `mv` and `cp` take those characters out rather than refusing, and their reply says
what the note is really called: `Created: Notes/Weekly report.md (renamed from "# Weekly
report.md": "#" cannot be used in a name)`. **Read the path back from the reply** — linking to
the name you asked for will point at nothing. A name that cleans to one already taken is still
refused, because that is a collision rather than a typo.

The usual way this happens is deriving a name from a markdown heading and keeping the `# `.
Apostrophes, commas, ampersands and percent signs are all fine and are left alone.

## Tasks

`type: task`. One note per task, in the tasks folder (`Tasks` by default).

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `created` | Date the task was made |
| `date` | The day it is scheduled for |
| `dateTime` | Time on that day, `HH:mm` |
| `due` | Deadline date |
| `dueTime` | Time of the deadline |
| `completed` | Date it was finished. Its presence is what "done" means |
| `recurrence` | Repeat rule, when it repeats |
| `groups` | What the task belongs to — the project, the person, the note it came out of |

A task has no priority, no tags and no nesting: that is a deliberate omission, not a gap to
fill with new properties. The task's own body is its description.

Completion is `completed` being set. Do not add a `done` or `status` property.

## Transactions

`type: transaction`. One note per transaction.

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `date` | When it happened |
| `from` | Wikilink to the account it left |
| `to` | Wikilink to the account it went to |
| `amount` | Number |
| `currency` | Currency code |
| `foreignAmount`, `foreignCurrency` | The same sum in a second currency, for multi-currency |
| `category` | Wikilink to a category note |
| `groups` | Anything the transaction relates to — a trip, a project, a person |

Whether a transaction counts as income, spending or a neutral transfer is decided by the
*types of the accounts on each side*, never by the sign of the amount. Amounts are positive.

## Accounts

Account notes are what `from` and `to` point at. An account's `type` is one of `asset`,
`revenue`, `expense`, `liability`, `computed`. Money moving from a `revenue` account to an
`asset` account is income; `asset` to `expense` is spending; `asset` to `asset` is a transfer
and changes no balance.

## Time entries

`type: time-entry`. One note per tracked stretch.

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `start` | Start, date and time |
| `end` | End, date and time. Absent or null means the timer is still running |
| `groups` | What the time was spent on |

Totals roll up through `groups`: time tracked against a task also counts towards the project
that task belongs to, and so on up.

## Journals

Journals are configured sets of dated notes — a daily note, a monthly one, a health diary —
each with its own path template such as `Journals/{{date:YYYY}}/{{date}}`. A journal note is
found by its date and path, not by a property, so creating one by hand in the wrong place
makes a second note for that day that nothing will find. Use the journal commands.

## Logs

A log is a piece of writing that shows up in the notes it mentions. Two kinds:

- **A paragraph** inside a note whose `type` is in the log types list (`journal`, `log`,
  `daily` by default). Every wikilink in that paragraph makes it appear in that note's timeline.
- **A whole note**, when it points at something through `groups` rather than in its body. This
  is how a meeting report is written.

So a line in a daily note mentioning `[[John]]` and `[[Coffee House]]` appears, dated, on both
of those notes. That is the plugin's central idea: write once, in the place you are writing,
and read it from every relevant context.

## Skills and prompts

Notes with `type: abele-skill` or `type: abele-prompt`. A skill teaches an agent how to do
something and is loaded on demand with the `skill` tool; a prompt is a reusable piece of text
for the person to insert into a chat. Both are ordinary notes and can be edited as such.

## Chats

Chats are `.abchat` files under the chat folder, one JSON record per line. Besides the
conversation, a chat's metadata record remembers what it *did*: `touched` lists the notes it
wrote to — created, edited, replaced, moved or copied into place, never merely read — each with
the time it was last written, and `recap` is a one-sentence summary of the work, written by the
background model after a turn that wrote something. Both are copied into the chat index in the
plugin's settings, which is what draws the **Chats** list under a note: one card per chat that
changed it, with its title, its recap and the date it was changed. A comment chat carries the
same fields but is not in the index, so it appears in no footer until it is opened as a full chat.
Renaming a note rewrites the path in both places. Do not edit these fields by hand.

## Comments

A comment chat is a conversation anchored to one place in a note. The anchor is a marker
written into the note's own text:

    The passage somebody asked about%%c:k7d2ph%%
    The same passage with two chats on it%%c:k7d2ph,3mq0xa%%
    A comment on a position rather than on any text:%%c:v9s1bn%%

`%%c:`, then one or more ids separated by commas, then `%%`. An id is six characters of
`[a-z0-9]`. The marker sits immediately after the passage it is about. Whether it quotes
anything depends on how the comment was made, not on what precedes the marker: one made with a
selection quotes that passage, one made without quotes nothing and marks a position instead.
Markers inside fenced code, inline code and frontmatter are not markers.

A marker is never written into the middle of a construct that a dozen characters would break: a
`[[link]]` or `![[embed]]`, a `[text](url)` link, inline code, a `==highlight==`, a `[^1]`
footnote reference, a callout's `[!type]` or a task's `[ ]` box. A comment made on a selection
that ended halfway through one of those is anchored after the end of it instead, and its quote
reaches that far as well. A fence, frontmatter, any line of a table and a callout's title line
have no such end, and a comment there is refused rather than written — the last two are drawn
by widgets of Obsidian's own, which swallow a marker whole and leave a comment nothing can
reach. The body lines of a callout take one normally.

**Never write, move or edit a marker.** It is an index into a file the plugin owns: an id with
no file behind it draws an icon that opens nothing, and a marker carried away from its passage
silently reattaches somebody's conversation to different text. Editing the note *around* a
marker is fine — surviving that is what it is for. To change the commented passage itself, use
`edit_selection` rather than `edit`: it moves the stored quote with the text.

Each comment is a chat file of its own at `AI/Comments/<id>.abchat` — the folder is
`commentFolder` in the settings — in the same format as any other `.abchat`. The quoted
passage lives there, as `anchor.quote` in the file's metadata, together with `anchor.note`,
the note the marker sits in. The note carries the marker and nothing else. Comment files stay
out of the chat history until somebody opens one as a full chat. Not every user turn in one was
a question: a comment may hold notes the person kept without asking anything, which no agent
has answered and which are simply part of the conversation from then on.

A single message in a comment can be *pinned*: its id is listed in `pinned` in the file's
metadata, and the plugin keeps that message on a small card at the top of the note's margin
until it is unpinned. Like the marker, `pinned` is not something to write by hand — an id with
no message behind it is a card the plugin will not draw, and the reader has no way to see that
anything was meant to be there.

## Transfer files

Files in the vault root named `Abele transfer <date> <time>.txt` are settings on their way to
another device: one line beginning `ABL1:`, holding the settings the person ticked on the
Transfer tab, compressed and — if a key went with them — encrypted. They are not notes, they
are not content, and nothing reads them except the Transfer tab on the receiving device. Leave
them alone; the person deletes them when the transfer has landed.
